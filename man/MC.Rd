\usage{
MC(yhat, y, metrics = FALSE)

\description{
Confusion Matrix is a contingency table that gives a visualization of the performance of an algorithm
}
\details{
Also it known as an error matrix. Normally, you can identify 4 elements, they known as true positive (TP),
true negative (TN), false positive (FP) and false negative (FN). To understand it, a simple example is presented:

\tabular{rcc}{ \tab Real Values \tab \cr Estimated \tab Class 1 \tab Class 2
  \cr Class 1 \tab TP \tab FP
  \cr Class 2 \tab FN \tab TN \cr }

  The problem arises that there is not always a clear relationship between which is the positive class or
  there may be different classes so it is also common to use the terms Type I error (FP),
  Type II error (FN) and unify the success or accuracy (TP+TN) in a single value.

  Suppose a 3x3 table with notation

\tabular{rccc}{ \tab Real Values \tab
\cr Estimated \tab Class 1 \tab Class 2 \tab Class 3
  \cr Class 1 \tab A \tab B \tab C
  \cr Class 2 \tab D \tab E \tab F
 \cr Class 3 \tab G  \tab H \tab I \cr
}
where N = A+B+C+D+E+F+G+H+I
The formulas used here are:
 \deqn{Success rate = (A+E+I)/N}
 \deqn{Type I error = (B+F+C)/N}
 \deqn{Type II error = (D+H+G)/N}


 Other indicators depends of one class and in the case choose Class 1
 \deqn{Sensitivity Class 1 = A/(A+D+G)}
 \deqn{Specificity Class 1 = (E+I)/(B+E+H+C+F+I)}
 \deqn{Precision Class 1 = A/(A+E+I),}
 also it is called Positive Predictive Value (PPV)
\deqn{Prevalence Class 1 = (A+D+G)/N}
}

if(interactive()){
 # You can create a confusion Matrix like a table

 RealValue <- c(1,0,1,0)
 Predicted <- c(1,1,1,0)

 MC(y = RealValue, yhat=Predicted ,metrics=TRUE)
