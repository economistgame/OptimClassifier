Patterns searching and binary classification in economic and financial data is a large field of research. There are a large part of the data that the target variable is binary. Nowadays, many methodologies are used, this package collects most popular and compare different configuration options for:

## Why in R?
[R](https://www.r-project.org/)  is an environment for statistical analyses and graphics that is rapidly gaining popularity with machine learning scientists. You can see [R-project](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) for one description about R and your ecosystem.
