Patterns searching and binary classification in economic and financial data is a large field of research. There are a large part of the data that the target variable is binary. Nowadays, many methodologies are used, this package collects most popular and compare different configuration options for Linear Models (LM), Generalized Linear Models (GLM), Linear Mixed Models (LMM), Discriminant Analysis (DA), Classification And Regression Trees (CART), Neural Networks (NN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
## Why in R?
[R is an environment](https://www.r-project.org/) for statistical analyses and graphics that is rapidly gaining popularity with machine learning scientists. You can see [R-project](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) for one description about R and your ecosystem.
