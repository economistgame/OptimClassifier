[R is an environment](https://www.r-project.org/) for statistical analyses and graphics that is rapidly gaining popularity with machine learning scientists. You can see [R-project](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) for one description about R and your ecosystem.

The **OptimClassifier** package provides a set of tools for creating models, selecting the best parameters combination for a model, and select the best threshold for your binary classification performed in [R](https://www.r-project.org/).  The principal objective of these website will help you to either use OptimClassifier and R ecosystem.
